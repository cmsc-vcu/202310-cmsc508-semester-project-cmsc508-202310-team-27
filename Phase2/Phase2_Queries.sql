-- and a column for the row totals.

--
-- If I need to compute the average number of countries in each region-income pair,
-- I need to make sure that I include the missing pairs, otherwise my denominator will 
-- be wrong and my average won't be accurate.
--
-- CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
-- combination of region and income category (including the missing '') value!
--
-- THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from the original pairings!
--
-- HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28 rows in your final table!
-- Review that Task 13 found all the non-zero pairs, and the answer is 22.  SO - this table result should have 6 rows!
