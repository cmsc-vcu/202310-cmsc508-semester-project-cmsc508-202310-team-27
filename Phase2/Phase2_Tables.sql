-- task 13 - Insert records into Doctor table using an API
-- DATA PIPELINE TRICK:
--   - create the appropriate INSERT command header
--   - THEN, use a spreadsheet to turn each row of the CSV file into 
--     an appropriately formatted VALUES statement,
--   - THEN, copy and paste the ENTIRE block of values into the DDL file below.
--   - This trick works with just about ANY table!
--   - Watch out for single apostrophes, they need to be manually converted to ''
--     take advantage of the VSCODE colors.
